This message likely comes from a data analysis tool or script (such as read_csv() in R or Python), indicating how the data was imported and the types of data detected in each column. Here's a breakdown of what it means:

Rows: 18005 Columns: 47: The dataset contains 18,005 rows and 47 columns.
Delimiter: ",": The data uses a comma (,) as the delimiter between columns (CSV format).
chr (11): There are 11 columns that are categorized as chr (character or string data type).
dbl (36): There are 36 columns that are categorized as dbl (double, meaning numeric data in floating-point format).
The message also suggests using spec() to retrieve the full specification for each column, which provides more detailed information on the column names and their data types.
You can suppress this message by specifying the column types or setting show_col_types = FALSE in your code.
This message is helpful in understanding the structure of your dataset, and it ensures that the data types have been assigned correctly.
