dont want summarise() has grouped output by 'DecreaseFunding'. You can override using the .groups

To prevent the message "summarise() has grouped output by 'DecreaseFunding'. You can override using the .groups argument." in R, you can simply suppress it by setting the .groupsargument to"drop"inside thesummarise()` function. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

r
Copy code
df %>%
  group_by(DecreaseFunding) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age), .groups = 'drop')
This will remove the message by dropping the grouping after the summarisation. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

it did not work

If setting .groups = 'drop' did not work, there are alternative ways to manage this issue in R. Try one of these approaches:

Approach 1: Use ungroup() after summarise()
This ensures that the grouping is explicitly removed after the summarization.

r
Copy code
df %>%
  group_by(DecreaseFunding) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age)) %>%
  ungroup()
Approach 2: Suppress the warning using suppressMessages()
If the warning still persists, you can suppress the message by wrapping the code in suppressMessages().

r
Copy code
suppressMessages(
  df %>%
    group_by(DecreaseFunding) %>%
    summarise(mean_age = mean(Age))
)
